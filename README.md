[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/grade/b15968aa0a524d2986ba5deac6801196)](https://www.codacy.com/app/kaljurand/K6nele)

Kõnele is an Android app that offers speech-to-text services to other apps.
Its main components are:

  - a voice search panel (i.e. a [RecognizerIntent](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognizerIntent.html) activity)
  - two implementations of [SpeechRecognizer](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/SpeechRecognizer.html), backed by two open source speech recognition servers
    - <https://github.com/alumae/kaldi-gstreamer-server>
    - <https://github.com/alumae/ruby-pocketsphinx-server>
  - a speech keyboard that implements the [input method editor (IME) API](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/inputmethodservice/InputMethodService.html)

The main goals of this project is to offer support for Estonian speech recognition on the
Android platform, as well as grammar-based speech recognition for voice command applications.

How to add support for other languages than Estonian is detailed in https://github.com/Kaljurand/K6nele/issues/38

For documentation, APKs, app store links, news etc. see <http://kaljurand.github.io/K6nele/>.


Building the APK from source
----------------------------

Clone the source code including the `net-speech-api` and `speechutils` submodules:

    git clone --recursive git@github.com:Kaljurand/K6nele.git


Point to the Android SDK directory by setting the environment variable
`ANDROID_HOME`, e.g.

    ANDROID_HOME=${HOME}/myapps/android-sdk/


Build the Kõnele app (tested with Gradle v4.10.3)

    gradle assemble

or

    ./gradlew assemble


If you have access to a release keystore then

  - point to its location by setting the environment variable `KEYSTORE`
  - set `KEY_ALIAS` to the key alias
  - create the file `gradle.properties` containing the lines:

        storePassword=<password1>
        keyPassword=<password2>


The (signed and unsigned) APKs will be generated into `app/build/outputs/apk/`.
